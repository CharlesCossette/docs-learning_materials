### VO vs V-SLAM

<br/>

There are fundamental differences between the problems of Visual Odometry and Visual SLAM (Self-localization and Mapping) in terms of the scope and applicability.

<br/>

Some noteworthy points in this regard are that :
<br/>

  * VO only aims to solve the **local consistency** of the trajectory
  * SLAM aims to solve the **global consistency** of the trajectory and of the map
  * VO can be used as a building block of SLAM
  * VO is SLAM before closing the loop.

### Types of Visual Odometry

<br/>
