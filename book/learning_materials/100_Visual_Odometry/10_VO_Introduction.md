## Visual Odometry : Introduction

### Definition
Visual odometry (VO) is the process of estimating the egomotion (pose) of an agent using only the input of a single or multiple cameras attached to it. 

### History

* **1980** : First known VO real-time implementation on a robot by Hans Moraveck PhD thesis 
            (NASA/JPL) for Mars rovers using one sliding camera (sliding stereo).  
            Very first idea of estimating a vehicle’s pose from visual input alone.
* **1980 - 2000** : The VO research was dominated by NASA/JPL in preparation of 2004 Mars mission 
* **2004**: VO used on a robot on another planet: Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity 

* **2004**  :   Formally described by Nistér et al. 2004 : the term “visual odometry” coined.
               VO was revived in the academic environment. The term VO became popular.
               The term was selected because vision-based localization is similar to the wheel 
               odometry that estimates motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its 
               wheels over time.
               VO integrates pixel displacements between image frames over time.

### Applications

* Robotics
* Wearable computing
* Augmented reality
* Autonomous vehicles
