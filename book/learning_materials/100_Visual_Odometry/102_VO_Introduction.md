# Visual Odometry : Introduction {#visual-odometry status=beta}

### Definition

<br/>


Visual odometry (VO) is the process of estimating the egomotion (pose) of an agent using only the input of a single or multiple cameras attached to it.

<br/>

**Example** : [video](https://youtu.be/lTQGTbrNssQ) showing the input images and VO computed for a moving vehicle.

<br/>

### History
<br/>

* **1980** :
<br/>
  First known VO real-time implementation on a robot by Hans Moraveck PhD thesis (NASA/JPL) for Mars rovers using one sliding camera (sliding stereo). Very first idea of estimating a vehicle’s pose from visual input alone.

<br/>

* **1980 - 2000** :
<br/>
  The VO research was dominated by NASA/JPL in preparation of 2004 Mars mission

<br/>

* **2004**:
<br/>
  VO used on a robot on another planet: Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity

<br/>

* **2004**  :
<br/>
   Formally described by Nistér et al. 2004 : the term “visual odometry” coined.
   <br/>

   VO was revived in the academic environment. The term VO became popular.
   The term was selected because vision-based localization is similar to the wheel odometry that estimates motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time.
   <br/>
   VO integrates pixel displacements between image frames over time.

### Applications
<br/>

* Robotics
* Wearable computing
* Augmented reality
* Autonomous vehicles
